                        As a school, our vision is securely aligned to creating opportunities for skill development that the 21st century learner must amass, to be ready for jobs that have not been ideated yet. Our greatest strength as a young, progressive school is therefore to optimise and capitalise on our ability to remain adaptable, open minded, build on the learning curve with an eye for the skills that need to be nurtured. Two decades ago, the world was not discussing apps on phones as they are today, two decades ago social media was not considered as impactful and two decades ago, we didn't think it possible to book tickets for a journey to Mars! The world therefore needs to prepare for the future, paving way for innovative options for learners as they take their place in the world.
